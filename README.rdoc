== Studio Scheduling Application

The purpose of this application is to provide an interface for users to book an appointment in a studio.  In addition to booking a timeslot on a calendar, users will also be able to reserve resources for use during the appointment. 

An admin user will be able to block off timeslots on the calendar, preventing users from making reservations during those times.
